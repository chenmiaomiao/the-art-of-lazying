Welcome to the Eink Words GPT project - a unique blend of e-ink technology and advanced AI (ChatGPT) to bring an innovative and dynamic approach to word learning. This project, part of my "The Art of Lazying" theme, integrates my life philosophy into various aspects of life, study, and vlogs. The Eink Words GPT aims to provide an engaging and effortless way to learn new words and their nuances.

## Features

- **Cutting-Edge Hardware:** Utilizes the latest Raspberry Pi 5 and a Waveshare 7-color 7.3-inch e-ink display, ensuring high-quality and reliable performance.
- **Dynamic Word Cards:** Displays words, their phonetics, syllables, and Japanese synonyms on the e-ink screen, providing a multifaceted learning experience.
- **AI-Powered Word Selection:** Leverages OpenAI's GPT models to dynamically fetch interesting and relevant words, tailored to our specific needs.
- **Culturally Rich Content:** Each word is accompanied by its Japanese synonym, offering a glimpse into another language and culture.
- **Art of Lazying Theme:** Designed under the "Art of Lazying" philosophy, the project aims to make learning efficient, enjoyable, and seamlessly integrated into daily life.
- **Open Source:** Share and contribute to the project, fostering a community of learners and developers.

## How It Works

The Eink Words GPT system, powered by Raspberry Pi 5, periodically selects a new set of words using the GPT model. These words are then displayed on the Waveshare e-ink screen, showcasing their phonetic transcription, syllables, and Japanese synonyms. The display updates at set intervals, providing a fresh set of words without any manual input - epitomizing the 'lazy', yet effective approach to learning.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine.
2. **Hardware Setup:** Ensure you have a Raspberry Pi 5 and a compatible Waveshare e-ink display.
3. **Dependencies:** Install the necessary Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt`.
4. **Configuration:** Configure the system with your OpenAI API key and database path.
5. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script to start displaying words on your e-ink screen.
