# ChatGPT Traffic: Domain Name to IP Address Resolver

This project provides a simple Python script for resolving domain names to IP addresses and collecting these addresses into a deduplicated list. This list also includes some custom IP addresses and CIDR blocks.

## Features

- **Domain Name Resolution**: Resolves specified domain names to their corresponding IPv4 addresses.
- **Deduplication and Error Handling**: Automatically removes duplicates and potential errors generated during the resolution process.
- **Custom IP and CIDR Support**: Allows adding custom IP addresses and CIDR blocks to the final list.

## How to Use

1. **Install Python and Dependencies**: This script requires a Python environment and the `dnspython` library. Install the required library with `pip install dnspython`.
2. **Configure the Script**: Modify the `custom_ips`, `cidr`, and `domains` lists as needed.
3. **Run the Script**: Run the script using Python, and it will output a deduplicated list of IP addresses.

## Example

Here's a simple example of the script:

```python
import dns.resolver

custom_ips = [
    # Custom IP addresses
]

cidr = [
    # Custom CIDR blocks
]

domains = [
    # List of domain names to resolve
]

# Code for resolving domains and processing results...
```
