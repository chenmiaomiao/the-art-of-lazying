# Python Code Merger for ChatGPT Integration

## Overview
Welcome to this innovative tool that effortlessly merges Python files from any repository, creating a consolidated document ideal for querying with AI models like ChatGPT. Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or AI enthusiast, this script is designed to streamline your workflow, enhancing your project's interaction with advanced AI technologies.

## Features
- **Directory-Wise Merging**: The script intelligently traverses through your specified source directory, merging all Python files (`*.py`) within each subdirectory.
- **Structured Output**: Merged files are organized into single documents, named after their respective subdirectories, ensuring easy navigation and reference.
- **Automated Directory Handling**: The script automatically creates the target directory if it doesn't exist, making it hassle-free to use.

## How It Works
The script operates by walking through the entire structure of your specified source directory. It identifies Python files and merges them into single `.txt` files, each representing a subdirectory. This method preserves the structure of your repository in a simplified, readable format, perfect for feeding into ChatGPT or other AI models for project querying and analysis.

## Usage
1. **Set Source Directory**: Specify the path to your project's root directory, where your Python files reside.
2. **Set Target Directory**: Choose a path where the merged files will be stored.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to merge the files. The output will be a series of `.txt` files, each containing the merged content of Python files from each subdirectory.

## Ideal Use Cases
- **AI-Assisted Code Review**: Merge your project's code and feed it into AI models like ChatGPT for quick insights or suggestions.
- **Project Documentation**: Easily create a document that represents your entire project's codebase, handy for reviews, archiving, or sharing.
- **Learning and Analysis**: Students and educators can use this tool to consolidate learning materials or project code for analysis and discussion.

## Getting Started
Simply clone this repository, set your directories in the script, and you're ready to merge your Python files in an AI-friendly format!
